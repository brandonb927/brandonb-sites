  I've always liked cars, especially Volkswagen-made vehicles. I'm also an amateur photographer working on leveling up my skills.

<p class="margin-tb">
  This page is an attempt at photographing and archiving my journey of owning my first "cool" car, something that I can appreciate and be proud of. It's also built using the Instagram API, and utilizes my technique for <a href="/developing-simple-json-apis-on-surge">building simple read-only APIs on Surge</a>.

  If you're reading this and are interested at all, I also have a build thread over on the <a href="http://www.golfmk7.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17652">GolfMk7 forums</a> that I'm using to catalogue the past, present, and future mods I want to complete.
