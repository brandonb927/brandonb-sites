I currently have my Canadian Amateur Radio Basic Qualification (with Honours) and am active on my callsign [VE7TZB](https://aprs.fi/?call=VE7TZB-9) from my home and outdoors.

I'm also part of the [Nanaimo Amateur Radio Association](http://www.ve7na.ca/) and [Cowichan Valley Amateur Radio Society](http://cvars.com) clubs.
