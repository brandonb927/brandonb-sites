I'm fairly new to amateur radio, but I currently have my Canadian Amateur Radio Basic Qualification (with Honours) and am active on my callsign [VE7TZB](https://aprs.fi/?call=VE7TZB) from my home and outdoors.

I'm also part of the [Nanaimo Amateur Radio Association](http://www.ve7na.ca/) and [Cowichan Valley Amateur Radio Society](http://cvars.com) clubs.

### My Rigs

In my truck I run a Kenwood TM-V71A 50W mobile transceiver connected to a Comet CA-2X4SR dual band 40" antenna attached to my roof rack.

At home I run another Kenwood TM-V71A 50W mobile transceiver as a base station powered by an Aimtom SPS-155 which is connected to grid power and will run for some time in the event of grid power loss (I eventually want to run this station off a large LiFePO4 battery). The station is connected to 25ft of LMR-400 which goes to a Diamond X50A dual band 5.6ft antenna in my attic. This station acts as an APRS IGate/Digipeater running through a DigiRig into a machine running Dire-Wolf 1.7.

I also have a few spare Baofeng handheld transceivers with 14" Nagoya whip antennas that I bring with me on outings.
