I'm a QA Developer at [Echosec](https://www.echosec.net) with more than 5 years experience ensuring the highest quality user-facing product experiences remain bug-free through automated testing and developer best practices. Formerly of Dyspatch/Sendwithus, and the Postach.io team at Input Logic. I have a deep passion for web development and you can check out some of my side projects over [here]({% link projects.html %}). I also teach a few classes at Vancouver Island University in the [ITAS program](https://itas.ca), focused around frontend web development and server-side technologies.

On the weekends I venture out to beautiful locations around where I live on [Vancouver Island, BC](https://www.google.ca/maps/@49.7879305,-125.7618705,8z), and with the amazing mountain and ocean scenery some of the other activities I like to do include biking, hiking, and camping.
