I'm a Front-end Product Developer at [SendWithUs](https://www.sendwithus.com), formerly a part of the Postach.io team at Input Logic. I have a fiery passion for front-end development, and as a product developer I'm talking directly to customers and shaping the face of the product.

As a side project I host a podcast called [Favicon Valley](http://faviconvalley.show) where I talk to other developers about their projects or products, and the stories behind them.

On the weekends I like to go to beautiful locations where I live on [Vancouver Island, BC](https://www.google.ca/maps/@49.7879305,-125.7618705,8z), and with the amazing mountain and ocean scenery around the area some of the other activities I like to do include biking, hiking, and camping.

I'm not available for hire right now, but you can view my resume [here](http://registry.jsonresume.org/brandonbrown).
