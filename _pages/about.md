I'm a Product QA Developer doing email stuff, ensuring our highest quality user-facing product experiences remain bug-free. Formerly a part of the Postach.io team at Input Logic. I have a deep passion for web development.

As a side project I host a podcast called [Favicon Valley](http://faviconvalley.show) where I talk to other developers about their projects and/or products and tell the stories behind them.

On the weekends I venture out to beautiful locations around where I live on [Vancouver Island, BC](https://www.google.ca/maps/@49.7879305,-125.7618705,8z), and with the amazing mountain and ocean scenery some of the other activities I like to do include biking, hiking, and camping.
