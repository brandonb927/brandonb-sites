I'm a Front-end Product Developer at [SendWithUs](https://www.sendwithus.com), formerly a part of the Postach.io team at Input Logic. I love front-end development because you're literally shaping the face of a product being built and are directly in talks with customers building the next big thing.

With the amazing mountain and ocean scenery around where I live, Vancouver Island BC, some of the other activities I like to do include biking, hiking, and camping.

I'm not available for hire right now, but you can view my resume [here](http://registry.jsonresume.org/brandonbrown).
