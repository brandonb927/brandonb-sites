This page has everything I use, both hardware and software-wise, to be a productive internet person (job titles are so pass√©). If you decide to make your own `uses` page on your site, consider adding it to [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) created by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos).

My primary work machine is a Mac so most tools and software listed here are macOS specific. I also want to make note of my "dotfiles" macOS bootstrapping scripts available here <https://github.com/brandonb927/dotfiles>.

## Code Editor

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Theme: [Min Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.min-theme) (a light variant is included with the theme)
- Font: [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)

## Desktop Apps

### Development

### Security

- [1Password Password Manager](https://1password.com/sign-up/ca/) ‚Äî üá®üá¶ Canadian and trustworthy, the two traits to look for in a quality product for storing passwords

### Productivity

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) ‚Äî because Spotlight search is ok, but not great
- [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) - reduces the strain of your screen on your eyes at night, backed by science!

- [Stay](https://cordlessdog.com/stay/) - I've never been happy with macOS window management when plugging a display into my computer, this allows you to store window locations on a per-display configuration basis

### macOS Maintenance

- [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com/) - when you want to visualize your disk space, this is the app you want to use

Throughout my office and the house I have a few IoT devices: some {% amazon B01K1JVZOE "TP-Link HS105 wifi outlets" %}, a few [Sonoff DIY smart switches](https://sonoff.tech/product/wifi-diy-smart-switches/basicr2), and two Echo Dot speakers which are basically used for two things: turning the smart switches on and off, and setting cooking timers.
