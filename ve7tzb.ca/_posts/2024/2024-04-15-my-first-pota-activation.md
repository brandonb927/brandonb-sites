I activated my first park on March 31 2024, Pacific Rim National Park (CA-0066) from Longbeach, and what a rush it was ðŸŽ‰ I was nervous for this first activation but I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and it paid off. I learned a lot with this event and I plan to get out and activate more frequently.

Setup for my activation was fairly straight forward: I brought camping chairs for both my wife and I, a small table to operate from and for the radio to sit on, and sunglasses because the sun was beating down on us on the beach.

Standard operating procedure when activating a park is a s follows:

> CQ POTA, CQ Parks on the Air, this is [callsign in phonetics] in [park reference] calling Parks on the Air
