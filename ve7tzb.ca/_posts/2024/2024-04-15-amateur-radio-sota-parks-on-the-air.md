I'm not a very active amateur radio operator... well, I monitor _a lot_ but I'm not "on the air" very much, except for when checking in to a [local](http://ve7na.ca) [club](https://cvars.ca) [net](https://www.rac.ca/nets/) and making the odd contact while operating mobile; other than that, I'm a little mic-shy (I know, I know...).

When activating a park

> CQ POTA, CQ Parks on the Air, this is [callsign in phonetics] in [park reference] calling Parks on the Air
