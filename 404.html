<div class="text-center">
  <h2>Hmm, looks like the content you were looking for up and left.</h2>

  <p>This is an awkward place to be, I know. Not being found and not knowing what to do is scary.
    In the meantime, you can <a href="{{ '' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">go home</a>
    and look for what you originally came to find there.</p>
</div>
