This page has everything I use, both hardware and software-wise, to be a productive person. If you decide to make your own `uses` page on your site, consider adding it to [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) created by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos).

My primary work operating system is macOS, so most tools and software listed here are specific to that. I also want to make note of my "dotfiles" macOS bootstrapping scripts available here <https://github.com/brandonb927/dotfiles> that are very opinionated, but a great starting point for others.

## Code Editor

## Desktop Apps

## Amateur Radio

In my truck I run a Kenwood TM-D710A (modified with internal GPS) 50W mobile transceiver connected to a Comet CA-2X4SR dual band 40" antenna. My shack consists of a Kenwood V71A 50W transceiver as my main radio and I have an old Kenwood commercial radio programmed to the APRS (144.390MHz) frequency acting as an iGate, which is connected to a DigiRig Mobile and Direwolf running on a Raspberry Pi 4. I also have a handful of Baofeng handheld transceivers with 14" Nagoya whip antennas as well.
