This page has everything I use, both hardware and software-wise, to be a productive internet person (job titles are so pass√©). If you decide to make your own `uses` page on your site, consider adding it to [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) created by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos).

My primary work machine is a Mac so most tools and software listed here are macOS specific. I also want to make note of my "dotfiles" macOS bootstrapping scripts available here <https://github.com/brandonb927/dotfiles>.

## Code Editor

### Productivity
