I'm fairly new to amateur radio, but I currently hold my Canadian Amateur Radio Basic Qualification (with Honours) and am active with my callsign [VE7TZB](https://aprs.fi/?call=VE7TZB) from home and the outdoors.

Some of the clubs I belong to are:

- [North Island Amateur Radio Society](https://niars.ca/)
- Director, [Nanaimo Amateur Radio Association](http://www.ve7na.ca/)
- [Cowichan Valley Amateur Radio Society](http://cvars.com)

You can check out my [profile on QRZ](https://www.qrz.com/db/ve7tzb) if you want to log a contact.

I help maintain a Discord bot that makes it easier to interact with various amateur radio information sources that you should try out: <https://github.com/brandonb927/amateur-radio-discord-bot>

### My Rigs

In my truck I run a Kenwood TM-D710A (modified with internal GPS) 50W mobile transceiver connected to a Comet CA-2X4SR dual band 40" antenna.

My QTH shack consists of a Kenwood V71A 50W transceiver as my main radio and I have an old Kenwood commercial radio programmed to the APRS (144.390MHz) frequency acting as an iGate, which is connected to a DigiRig Mobile and Direwolf running on a Raspberry Pi 4. I also have a handful of Baofeng handheld transceivers with 14" Nagoya whip antennas as well.
