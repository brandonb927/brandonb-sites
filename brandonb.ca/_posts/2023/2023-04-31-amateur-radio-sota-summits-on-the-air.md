I'm not a very active amateur radio operator... well, I monitor _a lot_ but I'm not "on the air" very much, except for when checking in to a [local](http://ve7na.ca) [club](https://cvars.ca) [net](https://www.rac.ca/nets/); other than that, I'm a little mic-shy (I know, I know).

My first QSO with someone activating a SOTA, or Summits On The Air, location was while randomly listening to the Island Trunk System (ITS) where they keyed up the repeater to announce they were doing a SOTA activation on another simplex frequency. Up until now I had heard about SOTA, and vaguely knew what it was, but I fired up the [website]() and refreshed myself, then tuned to the VHF frequency of 146.580MHz that they mentioned they were activating on.
