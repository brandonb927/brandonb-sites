I'm not a very active amateur radio operator... well, I monitor _a lot_ but I'm not "on the air" very much, except for when checking in to a [local](http://ve7na.ca) [club](https://cvars.ca) [net](https://www.rac.ca/nets/) and making the odd contact while operating mopbile; other than that, I'm a little mic-shy (I know, I know...).

My first QSO with someone activating a SOTA peak, or Summits On The Air as it's called, was while randomly listening to the Island Trunk System (ITS) while I was working from home. The operator keyed up the repeater frequency to announce they were doing a SOTA activation on another simplex frequency. Up until now I had heard about SOTA, and vaguely knew what it was, but I fired up the [website](https://www.sota.org.uk/) and refreshed myself on what was taking place, then tuned to the VHF frequency of 146.520MHz that they mentioned they were activating on.

After switching to the aforementioned frequency I listened for a few minutes and heard them start their activation. Once I listened to a few "chasers" call back, I figured out what I needed to say to get the operators attention and commenced calling back. Once we had confirmed details like exchanging confirmed callsigns, grid squares and signal reports, I signed off and had to take a walk around my house to wind down from my first exhilerating SOTA QSO!

When activating

> CQ CQ, this is [callsign in phonetics] on [summit name] calling Summits on the Air
> CQ CQ, Summits on the air â€” this is [callsign in phonetics] on [summit name]

More information on how the exchange of information works is available on the [ARRL website](http://www.arrl.org/radio-operating-from-summits).
