I'm not a very active amateur radio operator... well, I monitor _a lot_ but I'm not "on the air" very much, except for when checking in to a [local](http://ve7na.ca) [club](https://cvars.ca) [net](https://www.rac.ca/nets/) and making the odd contact while operating mobile; other than that, I'm a little mic-shy (I know, I know...).

Most folks I've run into in the amateur radio community say the only way to get over mic shyness is by getting on the air. But, what happens when you don't have the motivation to do it? Sometimes it's just not there...

Motivation is an interesting concept; incentivize an action of our own doing so we can achieve a goal.
