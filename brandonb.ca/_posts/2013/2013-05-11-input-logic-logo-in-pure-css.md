A few weeks ago I was interested in learning more about how the `:before` and `:after` psuedo-selectors are used from scratch as most of my exposure with them has been primarily through pre-made CSS and frameworks. I set out on a whim to recreate our startup's logo in pure CSS. This is the result, so enjoy it!
