Update: I just upgraded to OS X Mavericks, and documented the process over at my post on [TonyMacx86](http://www.tonymacx86.com/user-builds/93628-brandonb927s-build-core-i5-3470-ga-b75m-d3p-8gb-ram-evga-gt640.html#post573818).

A few years ago I tried to build myself a [hackintosh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86), a computer that is not an Apple-certified product that can run Apple's operating system OS X, and almost succeeded but was plagued with lack of funds and I broke a few things along hte way. This time around however, I thoroughly did my research using the [TonyMacx86 community](http://tonymacx86.com).

<!-- break -->

The system I chose to build has an Intel i5-3470 quad-core processor, 8GB of RAM, an EVGA GT 640 videocard with 2GB of memory and has a Samsung 840-series 120GB SSD running Windows 8 and a Kingston V100S/32G SSD running OS X 10.8.3.

I chronicled my process on the forums of TonyMacx86 and you can take a look [here](http://www.tonymacx86.com/user-builds/93628-brandonb927s-build-core-i5-3470-ga-b75m-d3p-8gb-ram-evga-gt640.html#post573818).

Here are some photos for the curious:
