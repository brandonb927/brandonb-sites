September 27th will be a day I remember for the rest of my life.

<!-- break -->

On that day Postach.io, the Evernote powered blogging platform developed by [Gavin Vickery](https://twitter.com/geekforbrains), [Shawn Adrian](https://twitter.com/nerdburn), and myself , won the Gold trophy and a slick \$20,000 cheque from Evernote for the [2013 Evernote Devcup](http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/09/27/blogging-tool-postach-io-wins-devcup-gold/). To top it off MC Hammer the famed hip-hop artist [HANDED US THE TROPHY ON STAGE](https://twitter.com/PostachioApp/status/383815580945358848).

I'll never forget the intense gut-wrenching and overwhelming anxiety I felt while Phil Libin, the Evernote CEO, decided to sidetrack while he was announcing the Devcup winners and bring MC Hammer onto the stage to present the winners. It felt like an eternity waiting to hear all of the teams being called up on stage before us. I became extremely antsy in my seat and couldn't stop moving when we heard that the Biscuit team won third place, and when the [Context Booster](http://www.contextbooster.com/) guys came on stage I started to lose my shit.

Finally, MC Hammer paused for a few seconds and mentioned the winner of the gold cup being Postach.io, I almost fell over when I jumped out of my seat.

Yeah that's MC Hammer 6-feet away from me, no big deal.
