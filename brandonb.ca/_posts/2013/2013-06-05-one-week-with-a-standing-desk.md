title: One week with a standing desk

Last week I blogged about [my standing desk](https://brandonb.ca/my-adventures-with-a-standing-desk) that I built to mend my distracting back pain. After only a week of using it I'd like to note my quick observations and the things I'm doing more often now.

Things I'm doing more frequently now that I'm already standing up are:

- stretching more
- walking around
- going outside to get some fresh air
- drink more water

Because I'm already standing, there are things I'd do maybe once a week while sitting that I do on a daily basis now, including move around more, drink more water, and even get outside more. I have a relatively small-sized garden in my backyard and I enjoy looking at the beautiful flowers that are planted there. Above all though, the major benefit to this whole setup is the fact that I haven't once experienced the back pain that drove me to where I am so far.

There are so many benefits to using a standing desk, but these are just my observations and are to be taken with a grain of salt or two. Let me know how a standing desk has helped your productivity in the comments!
