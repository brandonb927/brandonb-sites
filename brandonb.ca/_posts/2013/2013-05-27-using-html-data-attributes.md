I love trying to accompany as many people as possible because it's in my nature. Getting users from different nationalities to discover your content and be able to read it in their own language is awesome because it doesn't drive users away. David Walsh posted a cool article today about using the HTML `data` attribute to set localization and then style it with the CSS `content` attribute and because I love helping people with things, I created a [Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/brandonb927/pen/voGsu) version of it.
