title: Podcasts I Listen To Daily

Last updated: June 15th 2018

I mentioned it in a [previous blog post](/favicon-valley-podcast) that my commute to and from work is around 2 hours in total each day. I've been doing this for over 3 years now since I've joined [Sendwithus](https://www.sendwithus.com).

<!-- break -->

Initially I would listen to various local radio stations to keep me entertained, but I soon grew tired of the song playlists repeating every day. As most do I set out to rectify this and ended up finding out there are these things called "podcasts". Yeah, yeah, I knowâ€¦ "Where have you been for the past 15 years? Under a rock?" you say. Har-har, very funny.

When I first started listening to podcasts I searched for the term "web development" in iTunes and the iOS Podcasts app, subscribing to about 20 podcasts right off the bat not knowing what I was getting myself into. Once subscribed I began the process of wading through around 600 episodes to evaluate each podcast over the course of the last 5 months. For most of the podcasts I subscribed to, I would listen to about 10 episodes and if nothing piqued my interest by then I just gave up and tapped unsubscribe.

I now listen to a carefully curated handful of podcasts and I love all of them. I'm still on the lookout for different podcasts to enjoy, mostly in the internet/tech sector so if you have a recommendation that isn't below, please let me know. [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) has been a source of inspiration for me over the years and has a decent list of podcasts to listen to over on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/web-podcasts/) if you get bored of these. He posted the article in 2012 but most, if not all, of the shows listed are still running.

Note: denoted podcasts are shows I have started listening to and are not necessarily _new_ content.

Sorted by topic, here is a list of the podcasts:
