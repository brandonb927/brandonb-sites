I made some updates to my site to improve the experience and I moved from Handlebars to Nunjucks for templating. I much prefer the Jinja syntax for looping, etc. and the fact that I can do proper `if/else` statements is invaluable.

Some updates in my life include (sadly) losing my position at Input Logic working on Postach.io and QuoteRobot.com, and turning around within a week to jump on board with the amazing team at [SendWithUs](https://www.sendwithus.com/about) near the end of August, 2014. I'm brought on to update and eventually overhaul many front-end user-facing features.

I'm super excited to see where this new chapter in life takes me.

Happy hacking!
