title: Recreated OS X Twitter.app loader in CSS3

I was inspired and intrigued by the very simple and subtle Twitter loader for the OS X app when you pull down the list feed to refresh, so I set out to recreate it in CSS3. Prior to this I had no real understanding of how CSS3 Keyframes worked. I started out doing it in jQuery then changed it to pure CSS3 which performs far better with animations! It's very simple and elegant if you're into that sort of thing like me.
