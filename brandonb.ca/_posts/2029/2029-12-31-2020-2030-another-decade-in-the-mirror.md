### COVID-19

We're going to start with the elephant in the room: COVID-19. If you somehow lived under a rock for the last ten years, this is going to be unsettling. In the winter of 2019 it was announced that there was a very contagious novel coronavirus outbreak originating from [Wuhan, Hubei province, China](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9). A lot of the media at this time did not know how to report on these early cases and I remember that there was a lot of confusion and misinformation spreading quickly online.

[By early spring in 2020](CITATION NEEDED), this virus was identified as SARS-CoV-2 and established in our history forever to be known as [COVID-19](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html). Humankind was faced with an invisible enemy that required unwavering and absolute focus to be defeated; because we're humans, we royally screwed that up.

At the time these were some tips to avoid being infected with the virus:

- Practice "social distancing" whenever possible; stay at least 2 meters away from another person.
- Wear a mask whenever possible; N95 being far more effective than the standard blue hospital masks that became popular.
- Frequently wash your hands for at least twenty seconds.
- Don't touch a surface, or your face, then immediately rub your eyes, nose, or mouth.
- Carry and use hand sanitizer frequently, wherever you go.

For months, and even years, our healthcare systems across the globe were put to the test in one of the largest challenges we'd faced yet as a society. Hospitals were filled, literally to to the brim in most cases, with people who had contracted COVID-19 who needed ventilators in order to breath. Our doctors and nurses mental health and welfare began to nose dive in what is going to take another

Because of how easily COVID-19 can spread, it's prevelance made daily-life hard for many folks. Something as simple as going to a grocery store to acquire food, or standing within two meters of another human indoors (that was not within my immediate family-unit) felt wrong and gave me loads of anxiety.

Even with all the doom and gloom, at the time there was a bit of hope: some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies were working together to develop vaccines for the virus and on the eve of December 31 2020, the WHO [released a statement](https://www.who.int/news/item/31-12-2020-who-issues-its-first-emergency-use-validation-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-and-emphasizes-need-for-equitable-global-access) authorizing the emergency use of the mRNA vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech. This opened the door for other companies to develop their own vaccines, and by the end of 2021 we had multiple doses administered already.

After avoiding it for over two years, my wife and I somehow contracted COVID-19 while on our two-week honeymoon in O‚Äòahu, Hawaii. My symptoms felt like a mild cold, something I'm used to getting when I travel, but Brittany experienced it much worse; within a day she lost her sense of smell and taste and her recovery time was more than double mine. The good news is we enjoyed our honeymoon regardless, and we both recovered fully after 3 weeks respectively from the time of symptom onset. !!(I'm curious what the long-term issues may result in over time.)

It wasn't until the beginning of 2022 that things began to return to some form of normalcy, and by the end of the year it felt like things were finally "normal", whatever that means now. It meant that we could have family join us for holidays unencumbered by masks and social-distancing.

!!(I am not going to go into much more detail about what it is because by the time I review this statement we'll have been living with it for almost a decade)

### Bought a house

After living in Duncan, BC for over six years and commuting an hour each way for work, Brittany and I decided to move back to Nanaimo (45 minutes north of Duncan) to be closer to family and her job. We had run out of room in our condo and and Brittany was tired of commuting every single day while I was able to work from home. After we both decided that now was the time to move, we needed a REALTOR¬Æ and I had remembered that one was following me on Instagram. I looked at her profile, gave her a call and she showed up the next day to see if it woulkd be a good fit. Let me tell you, from the moment we started talking it became very apparent that this was the person we wanted to sell our condo and get us a house! [Brittany Pickard](https://brittanypickard.com/) is the hardest working realtors I've ever known and she put in work for us.

There were a few factors in our purchasing process that lead to a non-optimal situation:

1. We decided to buy a house at nearly the height of the COVID-19 pandemic; this lead to a lot of heartache on our side and we missed out on some great properties because our offer was competing to outbid (in most cases) several other people at the same time.
2. We didn't have the money to own a house AND own the condo at the same time which meant that we had to make our purchase with at least one subject clause: pending the sale of our condo. This inevitably turned out to be a big point of contention with most sellers and we lost out on a few offers as a result.
3. We had to purchase a home with no subjects becauser of how many offers there were on the table for most of the sellers; this meant we had to wave a home inspection. For some of the properties we looked at, this was a no-go for us.

Eventually, we lucked out so hard it made my head spin: in April of 2021, we viewed a property that was such a good fit told our realtor to submit an offer before we even left the place. We were told the only stipulation on the property was that it was [subject to probate](https://www.rew.ca/news/tips-for-buying-a-home-under-probate-1.22232237), which meant that the owner had passed away. Even with this knowledge we still submitted an offer knowing full-well there might be others on the table better than ours.

Later that night after trying to keep our minds off of the fact that we might actually get to own a house, we got the phone call from our realtor: we weren't the best offer on the table... but the family member handling the sale liked our offer letter so much that they'd be willing to take our offer over the competing offer if we could match their dollar ammount (for what it's worth we were $5000 shy of the competing offer). Needless to say I yelled emphatically into the phone "ABSO-FRIGGIN-LUTELY!".

Fast-forward to our possession and move-in date where probate had not been resolved yet; this gave us a bit of an uneasy feeling. We were ensured by our realtor that our move-in date was garunteed and the seller would not profit off her clients by "renting" the place to us in the meantime. Almost a month later and we got the phone call that our realtor had the court documents in hand, and that we could finally sign the title of the house into our name.

When we finally got the keys and walked through the front door for the first time as the owners, we were euphoric; it didn't matter that the walls were a gross yellow-brown that we'd eventually paint over, or that the drapes were this weird paisely floral combination that we'd replace, but that it was all ours to make our own.

### Married

On October 1, 2022 at 3pm PST, I married my best friend of **ten years** after having proposed just over two years prior. We celebrated our union in marriage in one of the most beautiful locations, with our closest friends and family, at Moorecroft Regional Park in Nanoose Bay, BC. Our wedding photographer was the ever-amazing [Chelsea Warren](https://chelseawarrenphotography.com/) who was an absolute joy to work with and we would recommend her to anyone who asks!

### Teaching

As of Nov 2022, I am in my fourth year teaching at Vancouver Island University.

### Echosec acquired

Echosec was acquired by Flashpoint in mid-2022. I am not enjoying the things I used to enjoy during the transition, Nov 2022. It feels like the fun of the job was stifled and stripped from me. This makes me salty about things because Echosec is a great place to work, but the acquisition did not yield anything in my favour (no stock options at all).

## New puppy

In September of 2023, after a year-long decision, we had an opportunity to drive to Campbell River one evening after work and see a puppy we saw on Kijiji. Once we saw him in person, we knew it was meant to be, and the rest is history. Meet Bento, our chihuahua-dachshund-pomeranian mix.
