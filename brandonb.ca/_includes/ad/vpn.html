  If you care about your privacy, using a trusted VPN is a requirement for doing anything on the internet these days. I have used <a href="{% link r/vpn.md %}" rel="nofollow">ExpressVPN</a> for over 7 years and after reading the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/best-vpn-anonymous-no-logging/">TorrentFreak 2024 review of VPN providers who do not log</a>, I think you should too. If you sign up with <a href="{% link r/vpn.md %}" rel="nofollow">my referral link</a>, we <strong>BOTH</strong> get 1 month of free service 😁!
