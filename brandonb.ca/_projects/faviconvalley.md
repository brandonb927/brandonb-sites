[ENDED] A show where I talked about products, email, and the web. I have preserved the old site [here on github](https://github.com/brandonb927/faviconvalley.show).

In the spirit of transparency, I'm publishing all the download/listen stats for the show alongside the episodes. Here is a table of the total all-time stats across all episodes since the show started:

### Ep 7 - Interview with Julian Lepinski of Cast

#### Show Notes:

Brandon chats with Julian Lepinski about his new product, [Cast](http://tryca.st), which makes the recording, editing, and distribution of podcasts incredibly simple. Cast allows you to invite guests to a private session (the Cast Studio) where you can record a conversation with multiple tracks. Once the episode is recorded, you take that conversation into the Cast Editor to slice and dice tracks into a well-produced show, then use the Cast Publisher to distribute your show in an RSS feed and view analytics for the listeners and downloads of episodes. Cast allows you to do everything all in once place!
